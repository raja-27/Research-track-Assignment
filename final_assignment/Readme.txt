The  software architecturefor the control of the robot in the environment. The software willrelyon the move_baseand gmappingpackages for localizingthe robot and plan the motion.The architectureshouldbe ableto getthe user request, and letthe robot executeone of the following behaviors(dependingon the userâ€™sinput):-1) moverandomlyin the environment, by choosing1 out of 6 possibletarget positions:[(-4,-3);(-4,2);(-4,7);(5,-7);(5,-3);(5,1)], implementinga random position service asin the assignment1-2) directlyaskthe user for the nexttarget position (checking thatthe position isone of the possiblesix) and reachit-3) start following the externalwalls-4) stop in the last position
